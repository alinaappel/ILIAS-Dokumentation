In this paper, we investigate which kinds of arrow types and icons ILIAS has and whether or not it is possible to shorten the amount of those.

The goal is to improve the user experience by
* sorting all types of arrows by their funcionality
* reducing the overload of the different arrow types and symbols to achieve a consistent look throughout the platform

# Issues with the current arrow types and their usage

When we roughly look over ILIAS we can already find many different forms of arrow icons, whether it is seen inside the mainbar, in the breadcrumb menue or in different kinds of buttons, such as the action button or different types of navigation buttons. When we start digging a little deeper inside the platform we found out that there are even more spots where arrow icons are used - also in places where it is important to question whether the implementation of an arrow icon is nessecary. By collecting all specific spots where an arrow is used, dividing them in logical groups and taking a look at the usability aspect, we noticed that there are many different usages and depictions of such an arrow, which can easily overwhelm the user. Many arrows have the same functionality while looking differently. In addition to that we took a look at the integration form of the arrow types.
